title: The Grouch Chorus
---

Grouches of the world unite! 
Stand up for your grouchly rights! 
Don't let the sunshine spoil the rain 
Just stand up and complain (heheheh) 

Let this be the grouches' cause: 
Point out everybody's flaws! 
Something is wrong with everything 
Except the way I sing! 

You know what's right with this world? Nuttin! 
You know what gets me hot under the collar? You name it! 
And the next time some goody-two-shoes smiles and tells you to have a nice day, just remember: 

Don't let the sunshine spoil the rain, 
Just stand up and complain! 
Just stand up and complain!
