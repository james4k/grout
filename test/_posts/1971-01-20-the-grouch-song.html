title: The Grouch Song
---

If you wake up in the morning mean and grumpy 
And you frown at ev'rybody that you see 
If you like your oatmeal nice and cold and lumpy 
Then you're a grouch like me 

If you love it when it's wet and cold and raining 
And the music that you like is all off key 
If you're happiest whenever you're complaining 
Then you're a grouch like me 

If you hate it when your grandma kisses you 
You know what? Well me, too! 
If you love to see a garbage truck roll by 
You know what? So do I! 
And if you think a great big pile of trash is pretty 
And that ice cream is yucchy as can be 
If you can't stand a cuddly little kitty, then you're a grouch like me 

If you hate it when your grandma kisses you 
You know what? Well me, too! 
If you love to see a garbage truck roll by 
You know what? So do I! 
And if you think a great big pile of trash is pretty 
And that ice cream is yucchy as can be 
If you can't stand a cuddly little kitty 
And you'd like to chase her up the nearest tree 
Then you can be pretty sure that you're a grouch like me
